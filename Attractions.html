                        Sri Lanka is second to none in terms of its biodiversity and can be considered the best for big game safaris outside the African continent. As bold a statement as that may be, Sri Lanka’s wildlife credentials speak for itself.
                        <br><br>Sri Lanka’s Big Five – leopard, elephant, sloth bear, blue whale, and sperm whale – are known as the country’s great wildlife attractions. These species are just some of the country’s plethora of wild species of fauna. It is also renowned as a birder’s paradise with an array of endemic, migratory, and resident avifauna found in its 70 Important Bird Areas strewn across its diverse landscape. Sri Lanka is also famous for its abundance of exotic flora.
                        <br><br>Amongst its many wildlife attractions, none have garnered such awe as those pertaining to the largest land mammal in the world – the elephant. Sri Lanka is home to the largest seasonally recurring concentration of wild elephants found anywhere in the world. This phenomenon known simply as The Gathering takes place in the country’s Minneriya National Park which is renowned the world over for being one of the best locations to spot elephant herds and observe their behaviour. Herds as large as 400 elephants have been recorded here in the past. Lonely Planet listed this occurrence as one of the Top Ten Wildlife Spectacles in the world. Sri Lankan elephants can also be spotted in several of the country’s 26 national parks including the Udawalawe National Park which is the only place in the world that guarantees an elephant sighting on each visit.<br><br>Sri Lanka’s wildlife crown jewel is the Sri Lankan leopard. Yala National Park is celebrated as the best place on Earth to see leopards as its leopard density is unmatched. Block 1 has a leopard for every square kilometre and these usually reclusive beasts are often spotted in these parts. Apart from the leopard, Sri Lanka is also home to other wildcats including jungle cats, civet cats, and rusty-spotted cats that can be found in Sri Lanka’s wilds.<br><br>The sloth bear is somewhat more elusive and its dwindling numbers have meant that spotting them in the wild is a rarity. However, in places such as Wasgamuwa National Park, Wilpattu National Park, and Yala, visitors have been able to catch a glimpse of these magnificent bears, especially during the Palu Season during which these marvellous mammals can be seen climbing the palu trees to gorge themselves on their favourite fruity snacks.

                        Sri Lanka is also an amazing place to visit for those interested in birding. It has dozens of bird sanctuaries and Important Bird Areas where an eye-catching array of avifauna can be viewed. The Kumana and Bundala National Parks are birding hotspots where almost every species of bird recorded in Sri Lanka can be seen. The Sinharaja Bird Wave is also a well-known attraction in Sri Lanka, providing visitors with the largest and longest studied bird waves on the island.
                        <br><br>The island is also considered the best place in the world to spot the largest animal that has ever lived on earth – the blue whale. The coastlines of Mirissa and Trincomalee offer the best locations for viewing these magnificent beasts while Kalpitiya is known as one of the world’s top ten best sites to catch a glimpse of the amazing sperm whale – the biggest toothed whale in the world. Meanwhile, Mirissa additionally offers visitors the best chance at seeing both these magnificent mammals of the ocean on the same tour.<br><br> wildlife of Sri Lanka is one of the country’s defining attractions and few countries can rival Sri Lankan wildlife and its combination of big game safari animals, species densities, and its tourism infrastructure. It is well and truly the ultimate safari island.</p>

                            Sports tourism is defined as either people being involved in, observing or participating in a particular sporting event for leisure.
                            Sri Lanka is also a destination for sports such as cricket, rugby, golf and surfing. Except for cricket, the contribution to the tourism sector from other sports are still at a very low level. Apart from mainstream sports events, adventure sports are also included in sports tourism.

                            The cultivation of many types of rice, spices, vegetables and fruit, coupled with past foreign influences, ensures that Sri Lanka enjoys a varied and select cuisine. As a staple, rice is consumed with an assortment of colourful curries (eggplant, potato, green banana, chicken, fish) that range in potency from delicately-spiced to near-dynamite.
                            <br><br>Other Sri Lankan staples include hoppers (a pancake-like snack), string hoppers (steamed rice noodles) and pittu (a mixture of flour and coconut). Lamprais - rice and accompaniments baked in plantain leaves - is a legacy of the Dutch. Seafood lovers will rejoice at the fresh fish, prawns, crab, squid and crayfish available. Desserts include buffalo curd eaten with palm-honey, and the Malay-derived caramel-like wattalapam.
                            <br><br>Sri Lanka has a wonderful array of snacks, known as short eats, named cutlets, patties, malu pang (fish bun), and kimbula bunis (crocodile-shaped bun!) that are excellent for trips.
                            <br><br>Delectable fruit includes the popular mango, pineapple, banana and papaya, but also many lesser-known but distinctive examples such as sapodilla, mangosteen, rambuttan, woodapple, custard apple and beli.

                        <p>Sri Lanka with its nearly 3000 years of history holds some of world’s ancient cities including Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Digamadulla. Remnants of these once glorious cities, their palaces, temples, monasteries, hospitals and theaters intricately carved and modeled out of stone lay abandoned amidst the soaring mountains.
                        <br><br>Of all the ancient sites the most famed and most exquisite is the Kingdom of Anuradhapura. Sri Lanka’s third and the longest serving capital and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world is also one of the most sacred cities of World Buddhists. It was the capital of Sri Lanka from the Fourth Century BC up to the turn of the eleventh Century and was one of the most stable and durable centers of political power and urban life in South Asia. However the city itself is much older than the Kingdom of Anuradhapura and according to archeological evidence could have originated as far as tenth century BC. Anuradhapura was abandoned due to the due to repeated South Indian Invasions and was eventually forgotten with time until it was rediscovered in the early 19 th century.
                        <br><br>Polonnaruwa, the second most ancient kingdom of the country was first made the political center of the country in the ninth century BC. Irrigation systems that are far superior to those of the Anuradhapura Age were constructed in Polonnaruwa kingdom, and still provide irrigation water to the farmers in and around Polonnaruwa. Yet the kingdom’s glory was short-lived and a South Indian invasion pushed the political centre towards the centre of the country by the eleventh century. Today the ancient city of Polonnaruwa remains one of the best planned archaeological relic sites in the country, a testimony to the discipline and greatness of the Kingdom's first rulers.
                        <br><br>Digamadulla, the Eastern kingdom of Sri Lanka was the agricultural and spiritual capital of the country during the Anuradhapura kingdom. Ruled by a viceroy of the Anuradhapura king Digamadulla was a prosperous province with grand palace, monasteries and temples at every juncture. Having received lesser attention of archaeologists compared to Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa many a great creations of ancient Digamadulla had been lost to time, war and plunder while many more silently awaits in the midst of the forests covering the lands of Eastern Sri Lanka.</p>

                            Sri Lanka is a tropical island found in the deep blue waters of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. The country is endowed with over a thousand miles of beautiful golden beaches that are fringed with coconut palms making it the ideal destination for a beach holiday. A large percentage of luxurious resorts and villas as well as budget hotels are located along the coastal areas to offer tourists some of the best beach holidays in Sri Lanka. The main attraction for tourists and locals are undoubtedly the beaches but some places like Galle on the South coast consists of historical heritage which is an added advantage to a sun and sand holiday. The drive along the west and south-west coast also offers interesting stopovers such as batik factories or turtle hatcheries, or activities like paying homage at a local temple, sampling local fruits from roadside vendors and getting first-hand knowledge on the art of toddy making.
                            <br><br>There are many areas around the island that you can explore and enjoy various activities while beach holidays in Sri Lanka boast to be the best. The western and southern coastal beaches begins from Negombo, 37 km north of Colombo and curves south along the coastline for 273 km up to Hambantota. This is definitely the better developed of the two circuits in the island and currently accounts for most of the hotels and resorts. The South of Colombo which is also called the ”Gold Coast” is bursting with action with resorts stretching from Mt. Lavinia (a suburb of Colombo) and continuing along the towns of Wadduwa, Kalutara, Beruwala, Bentota, Induruwa, Kosgoda, Ahungalla, Hikkaduwa, Galle, Unawatuna, Koggala, Weligama, Mirissa, Dondra, Dickwella, Tangalle and finally Hambantota. The southern beaches are sandier than the western ones and do not shelve deeply into the sea.
                            <br><br>The eastern and northern coastal beaches stretches north in a gentle arc from Arugam Bay up to Kuchchaveli approximately 275 km along the east coast. Pristine beaches, wide stretches of sand and what seems like miles of clear and shallow water, pretty bays and coves, deep natural harbours, still lagoons and underwater coral gardens will always take your breath away. The best beaches along the east coast include Nilaveli, Kuchchaveli, Marble Bay, Sweat Bay and the Dead Man’s Cove with its magnificent harbour, towards the north of Trincomalee. The southern section of the east coast includes the peaceful and beautiful beaches of Passikudah, Kalkudah and Arugam Bay.
                            <br><br>With miles of golden beaches, sun and sea, our little island offers you the convenience of travelling to some of the best locations without wasting much time. You can access the western and southern coastal beaches by road starting off from the Negombo Route A3, up to Colombo. Then get the A2, better known as the Galle Road up to the city of Galle, 117kms south of Colombo. This coast line runs all the way till Hambantota before veering away towards Wellawaya which is further inland. The railway currently runs from Negombo to Matara, just short of Dondra Head, which is the southernmost tip of Sri Lanka. From Dondra, Hambantota is just 78 km by road. If you prefer flying, there are International airports at Katunayake, which is the airport servicing Colombo and also one in Mattala in the Hambantota district, along with smaller domestic air spaces in Moratuwa and Koggala.
