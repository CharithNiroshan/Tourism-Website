                <h2>Get on board: the best train journeys in Sri Lanka</h2>
                <p>
                    There are train rides, then there are Sri Lankan train rides. The teardrop island in the Laccadive Sea may be small, but it packs in some of the world’s most thrilling rail journeys. You could find yourself rattling past suburbs with a fellow commuter dozing on your shoulder or perhaps weaving in and out of emerald-green tea gardens and thickets of tropical rainforest while tucking into a packed-to-go meal of curry and rice; sometimes both in the same journey. <br><br>The steam trains that once transported tea and spices along these weaving rail lines have mostly vanished, but the colourful diesel locos that replaced them offer the same evocative transect through the Sri Lankan landscape. If you’re a lover of travel by locomotive, make sure you book tickets (in advance!) for one of these four epic train journeys around Sri Lanka.

                <h2>The rewards of slow travel on Sri Lanka's waterways</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m putt-putting my way along the waters of the Madu River in Sri Lanka, when local boatman Manis points out the highlighter-bright birdlife in the trees. The riverbanks are thick with foliage of banana, cinnamon and balsa trees, and birds aren't the only thing on display; the branches of the balsa being polka-dotted by poisonous lime-green fruit. I look up to see a hawk seemingly pause in midair. <br><br>On our way we pass only a few other boats: fishermen balancing on narrow canoes, and two or three small tourist boats filled with visitors who gaze back at us from behind their cameras as we glide past. When thinking of Sri Lanka, I think of elephants and rock temples, of Buddhism and beaches, of surfing and turtles. It’s not a country that I associate with boat trips and kayaks. Yet these inland waters are some of the country’s more hidden splendours.

                <p>
                    The morning sun warms the back of my neck as I float on a foam-topped surfboard in the cerulean shallows of Sri Lanka’s Arugam Bay. My instructor, whose swim attire includes a baseball cap and a pair of thick sunglasses, drifts on his own board nearby, dispensing advice on how I should go about catching the next wave. <br><br>As an oncoming swell starts to break, frothing like the jaws of a rabid dog, I begin frantically paddling towards shore. For one glorious moment the wave carries me along, until the nose of my longboard plunges beneath the water and I’m sent somersaulting head-first through the surf.

                <p>
                  Think of Sri Lanka and, aside from images of Tamil Tiger strife, it might be hard to picture anything except palm trees, azure seas and sumptuous white sand beaches. And it’s true that sinking into the sands of Mirissa or Bentota, you might be tempted to do little more strenuous than ordering a Lion lager for the remainder of your stay. But if you can summon the energy to wrest yourself from its sandy southern reaches, there’s plenty to see but sea on this stellar island, whose architectural heritage is as rich and varied as its boutique hotels’ fine dining menus. <br><br>The obvious first step on a Sri Lanka architectural itinerary is 17th century Galle walled fort, one of seven UNESCO World heritage sites on the island, and set just steps away from those glorious beaches on the south coast.

                <h2>Backpacker hacks: how I travel using art as currency</h2>
                <p>
                  Backpackers often volunteer in exchange for accommodation when travelling as a way of cutting costs. This usually consists of housekeeping, teaching English or farming, but as one travelling artist discovered, many hostels are open to more creative work stay arrangements. <br><br>London-based street artist Frankie Strand is renowned for her vibrant, larger-than-life murals. For the last five years, she’s painted for everything from Milan Fashion Week to Greenpeace at Glastonbury. If Frankie’s not using her work to promote conservation and spotlight environmental issues, she’s using her love of bright colours and unruly surfaces to decorate endless walls across countless cities.

                <p>
                    “Welcome to Sri Lanka!” was one of the first greetings I heard in Colombo, the country's bustling big city. A local graced me with those lovely words from across the street. Not a storekeeper, nor a hawker. Just a person who wanted to pass on a warm hello. <br><br>Sri Lanka is a country generally appreciative of tourism, after all the petite country has endured its fair share of hardship and the attacks in April 2019 just added to the list.<br><br> The toll on tourism has been tremendous on the island state. According to travel consultancy ForwardKeys, average net bookings to and within Sri Lanka fell 186% the week following the attack.

                <p>
                    After a tumultuous two decades of political instability and civil war, calm has returned to Sri Lanka, and visitors are flooding back. This Indian Ocean island has a deserved reputation as a top spot for adventurous backpackers, but going for a family holiday – was that a step too far?<br><br> As a travel writer, I needed to find out. Luckily, my wife loves adventure, and the kids were happy to come along for the ride, so we set out in search of the perfect Indian Ocean family holiday. </p>

                    It sounds mundane: 'rice & curry' but it's really sublime. The national dish of Sri Lanka is a melange of flavours and dishes – an ever-changing array of tastes reflecting the skills of the cook and the bounty of the markets. <br><br>Sri Lanka's history and culture come together like a rice and curry meal. Its strategic position on the route between East and West and the neighbours, traders, immigrants and colonisers who have left their mark, together with its blend of Indian, Portuguese, English, Arab, Malay and Dutch cultures.

                <p>
                    Even by the pearl-studded standards of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka is a jewel. Visitors flock here for the rich and diverse culture, beautiful sand-sprinkled beaches and astoundingly varied wildlife. Elephants, monkeys, leopards and sloth bears are the stars of the show on land, while whales and dolphins vie for attention off-shore. <br><br>However, Sri Lanka’s record on animal welfare is not so rosy, especially when it comes to elephants, which are often subjected to cruelty or kept in poor conditions, frequently in chains. Even in some national parks, the crowds of wildlife spotters can be visibly distressing to wild animals.

                    While soft-sand beaches and lowland jungles may be the first images that leap to mind when you imagine Sri Lanka, this tropical isle is endowed with a mountainous interior that is every bit as scenic as the coast, blessed by pleasantly cool temperatures that rarely tip 21ºC. <br><br>Rising at dawn is the best way to see this region of Sri Lanka burst into life, as the rising sun spills across lush and sweeping amphitheaters of green, and views stretch to the horizon, undimmed by early mists and the clouds that roll in mid-morning, obscuring famous vistas.
